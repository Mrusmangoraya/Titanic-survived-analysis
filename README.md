# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis - Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques. It explores the dataset through EDA and builds predictive models to classify survival based on passenger details.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Format: CSV
- Features include: `Age`, `Sex`, `Pclass`, `SibSp`, `Fare`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features using classification algorithms.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🎯 Survival Distribution
![Survival Ratio](./survived.png)

- **61.6%** passengers did not survive.
- **38.4%** passengers survived.

### 👶 Age & Gender-wise Survival
![Survival by Age & Gender](./titanic.png)

- **Women and children** had higher survival chances.
- Most **men** did not survive, especially in lower classes.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy Achieved: **~81%**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Jupyter notebook: `Titanic.ipynb`
3. Make sure all required libraries are installed

---

## ✅ Results
- Logistic regression performed well with categorical features encoded.
- Model predicted survival with ~81% accuracy.

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- Try other models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
